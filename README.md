# Oracle EBS on OCI - Terraform modules for Partners

## Summary
This repository covers the terraform code for EBS on OCI, the respository is organized into two diferent architectures blueprint:

- Single AD with DR on different regions
- Multi AD with the same region

To execute the terraform script, please follow these instructions:

- [Configure your tenancy and user for terraform script](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/API/SDKDocs/terraformgetstarted.htm)
- [Export your credentials](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/oci/index.html)

## Oracle E-Business Suite Terraform modules structure
Each directory represents one EBS environment structure on its own, with terraform and configuration files:

- [**docs**]: Folder for document images of the Architecture
- [**modules**]: The modules directory contain all the modules required for creating Oracle Cloud Infrastructure resources.
  - [bastion]: This module is used to create bastion hosts.
  - [compute]: This module is used  to create unix and windows compute instances.
  - [dbsystem]: This module is used to create Oracle Cloud Infrastructure database system.
  - [loadbalancer]: This module is used to create Oracle Cloud Infrastructure load Balancing service.
- [**Multi-AD-Architecture**]: This is the EBS environment for Multi-AD Architecture on the same region deployment.
- [**printscreens**]: Some print screens from the terraform execution of the environments.
- [**Single-AD-DR-Architecture**]: This is the EBS environment for Single AD with DR on different region deployment.
  - [Region1]: The first active region for EBS deployment.
  - [Region2]: The DR passive region for EBS deployment.

### How to execute
To execute the terraform code, configure the variable files as described above, save your changes and load the environment variable "source env-vars" before calling any terraform command, this'll prevent you from imputing variables manually on the console.

<p align="center">
  <img src="./docs/PrintScreen-00.jpg">
</p>

 After loading the variables, you can perform the "terraform init" command, to load the modules and OCI terraform provider.

  <img src="./docs/PrintScreen-01.jpg">
</p>

After executing terraform init, you can perform "terraform apply" to create your environment, before submitting your environment, please review all changes on the OCI tenant that you are requesting to create, make sure you have the necessary service limits to create all the infrastructure and instances on your tenant.

This sample created 58 resources on OCI tenant.
